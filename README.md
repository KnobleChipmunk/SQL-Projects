# SQL-Projects

These projects have been modified to remove confidential information. 

Project #1's use case is to delete and reset data based on a number of parameters. 22 distinct tables are utilized in this example. Three temporary tables are used to store information and a WHILE loop is used to execute one of two stored procedures.

Project #2 is used to generate data based on the declared variables 1-9. Not all variables are required. This template makes use of the SP_EXECUTESQL T-SQL stored procedure. A series of validations are written to ensure that the final query is specific to the variables which are declared by the user.
